# For Jupyter Users

## 1. g2nb Meta-Package

g2nb consists of a collection of Python packages and extensions for JupyterLab. It provides a variety
of tools for interacting with powerful analysis platforms from
within a Jupyter environment. These tools include:

*   Visual widgets for running bioinformatic analyses and submitting
    these analyses to a GenePattern or Galaxy server and for starting interactive visualizations using IGV and CytoScape.
*   Tools for visually sending results to downstream steps in a
    bioinformatic workflow.
*   A WYSIWYG-style rich text editor for Markdown cells.
*   Python libraries for programmatically working with the results of
    the analyses.

g2nb usage is free and the software is open source under the [BSD license](https://github.com/g2nb/g2nb/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

## 2. What is GenePattern?

GenePattern is a powerful platform for reproducible bioinformatics
research. It provides hundreds of analytical tools for the analysis of
gene expression ([RNA-seq](http://genepattern.org/rna-seq-analysis) and [microarray](http://genepattern.org/gene-expression-analysis)), [sequence variation and copy
number](http://genepattern.org/variant-and-copy-number-analysis), [proteomic](http://genepattern.org/proteomics), [flow cytometry](http://genepattern.org/flow-cytometry), and network analysis.

For more information visit [the GenePattern website](http://genepattern.org/). For introductory
information about GenePattern, please see our [10-minute tutorial](http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/quick-start) and/or
check out one of our [video tutorials](http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/video-tutorials).

## 3. What is Galaxy?

[Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org) is an open source, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research. You can 
install your own Galaxy instance or use the main Galaxy server and choose from thousands of tools from the Tool Shed.

For more information visit [the Galaxy tutorial page](https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/g101/).

## 4. What is Cytoscape?

Cytoscape is an open source software platform for visualizing complex networks and integrating these with any type of 
attribute data. A lot of Apps are available for various kinds of problem domains, including bioinformatics, social 
network analysis, and semantic web.

For more information visit the [Cytoscape website](https://cytoscape.org/).

## 5. What is IGV?

The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance, easy-to-use, interactive tool for the visual exploration of 
genomic data. It supports flexible integration of all the common types of genomic data and metadata, investigator-generated 
or publicly available, loaded from local or cloud sources.

For more information visit the [IGV webpage](https://igv.org).

## 7. UI Builder

The UI Builder is a way to display any Python function or method call as
an interactive widget. This will render the parameters of the function
as a web form which can be filled out with numbers, string literals or
with references to existing Python variables. Clicking the `Run` button on
the widget will validate the form and execute the function using the
supplied values.

The UI Builder will use any existing docstring for the function as a
description in the widget, will infer parameter types from default
values and will display parameter annotations as helpful text near each
input.

To use render a function, simply import the `UIBuilder` class from the
`nbtools` package and pass the function to its constructor.
